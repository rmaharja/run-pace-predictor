Find Your Pace

Find Your Pace (FYP) is a run pace calculator that estimates your predicted pace for training runs and races based on today's weather.

Running in circles trying to figure out if you ran a 7:19 or a 7:17 minutes per mile pace in your last race? Find Your Pace does the math for you! Just enter your personal best time from a race or time trial, the race distance, the temperature, dew point, and wind speed from that day, and where you're running today, and FYP will tell you your pace and estimate your running performance today.

This web app was built by runners, for runners. As runners, we are laser-focused on time and challenging ourselves to run each race faster than we've ever run before. We were frustrated that our race times always seemed to slow down in the summer heat (especially in New York and DC!), no matter how many miles we put in. As it turns out, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed hace a significant effect on running pace! Let's say you run a personal best half marathon time in the cool temps and low winds of early March in Brooklyn while you're in peak marathon training shape. When the mercury rises come July, there's a good chance your time at a 10k will only be a few seconds faster per mile than your HM personal best beacause of the heat, and a summer half could be upwards of 20 seconds slower per mile. You may feel slugish, but racing and training at these paces serve the same cardio benefit as your faster winter paces! Enter your times, the weather, and your location into FYP, and see how much the summer heat and humidity are affecting your pace. If you're beating those times, congrats! That means you've gotten faster and fitter. Either way, after enduring the heat and humidity of summer training, come fall, your times will drop with the temps and you'll feel like Superman.

We used to use several different online calculators to figure out our training paces, whether the weather and humidity were going to affect our ability to run, and how much to adjust our paces by, etc, and we realized we could build something greater than the sum of its parts. Now we're spending less time calculating, and more time running ðŸ˜‰.

Find Your Pace is built using HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON.

Thank you to Dark Sky and Google Maps for providing the awesome APIs that made this app possible! https://darksky.net/dev/docs/faq https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/

We look forward to building out more features on Find Your Pace and making it even more user-friendly. In the meantime, let us know what you think and what you would like to see next!
